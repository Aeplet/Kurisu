title: Is the new Switch update safe?
help-desc: Quick advice for new versions
---

Currently, the latest Switch system firmware is `{nx_firmware}`.

If your Switch is **unpatched**:
Atmosphere and Hekate **DO NOT** currently support {nx_firmware}, and unpatched units will always be hackable once Atmosphere and Hekate support the firmware.
You should **avoid updating until there are new releases of these core tools**.

If your Switch is **hardware patched**:
Any unit that is Mariko or above (aka 'redbox' Switches, Switch Lites, Switch OLED, etc) is *unlikely to ever be hackable*.
