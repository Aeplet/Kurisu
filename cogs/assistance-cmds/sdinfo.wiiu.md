The minimum SD card requirements for Wii U homebrew is 2GB, and must be FAT32 with an MBR partition table.

Recommended size is 32GB. You can typically use any size under that. You can go for a larger one as well. The maximum size limit is 2TB. 

But realistically, anything 64GB and above is excessive. You won't *ever* need that much space, unless of course you want to use SDUSB, which spoofs a partition on the SD card to be recognized as a USB storage drive, but should still be much less than 1TB.
