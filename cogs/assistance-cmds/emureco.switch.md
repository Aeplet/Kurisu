On the Switch system, it is recommended to use an emuMMC/emuNAND.
An emuMMC/emuNAND will take up approximately 30GB on your SD card, so the SD card must be 64GB or above.
The purpose of an emuMMC/emuNAND is to give you a safe place to use custom firmware functions.
This will allow you to keep your sysMMC/sysNAND clean, so you can use it online.
Following the default NH server guide (type `.guide nx` in <#261581918653513729> for a link) will set you up with an emuMMC/emuNAND.
