No, you don't need to insert your SD card in the Wii U before modding it. It does not give you files, and the SD will not show in data management. The Wii U handles storage from either its own internal chip (emmc) or from external storage drives.
 
The SD card is primarily used for vWii, Mii Maker and Smash 4 content. You cannot install games to it natively(additional software is required).

Just proceed with the guide as normal, it has everything you need for the homebrewing process.
