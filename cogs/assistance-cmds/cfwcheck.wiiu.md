Need to update to a newer CFW? Check for which one you have before proceeding.

Mocha: It is launched manually from the Homebrew Launcher. You do not need to do anything special.

Indexiine: Launches the Homebrew Launcher automatically while opening the browser. Follow the [Uninstall Indexiine](https://wiiu.hacks.guide/uninstall-indexiine.html) guide to remove it.

Haxchi: Launched from the Wii U Menu, will appear as "Haxchi". You can simply delete it from Data Management in System Settings.

CBHC: Launches on boot with a black screen that says `Autobooting....` and has a `DON'T TOUCH ME` icon. Properly uninstall it with the [Uninstall CBHC](https://wiiu.hacks.guide/uninstall-cbhc.html) guide.

Tiramisu: Launches either on boot or while launching health and safety, will show a black screen + white line upon launch. Follow [Moving from Tiramisu to Aroma](https://wiki.hacks.guide/wiki/Wii_U:Moving_from_Tiramisu_to_Aroma).
