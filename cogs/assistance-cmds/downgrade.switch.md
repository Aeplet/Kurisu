Downgrading your firmware on the Switch is not recommended. This will generally lead to a lot of issues and won't solve anything.

# Possible side effects from downgrading:
* Unable to boot if performed incorrectly.
* Unable to boot due to a mismatched efuse count.
* Inability to use your gamecards.
* Save data compatibility issues.
* Games not launching.
