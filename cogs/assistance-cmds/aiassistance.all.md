- LLMs (such as ChatGPT, Gemini, Google AI, etc) tend
to pull information from the internet, whatever it
can find, without verifying if it is actually true.
- The information these LLMs pull from the internet
is often critically wrong, in a way that numerous
consoles have been bricked by it.
- ChatGPT in particular, hallucinates to sound smart
about these things, meanwhile it does not verify
anything it says when it comes to this.
