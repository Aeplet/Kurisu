# Make sure to follow the following rules when installing CBHC:
- The DS game has to be legitimately installed from the eShop!
- Don’t format the system while CBHC is installed!
- Don’t delete the user account that bought the DS VC game!
- Don’t re-install the same game using WUP Installer or from the eShop!
- Don’t install Haxchi over CBHC! (You will not brick, but it will cause a boot-loop! Hold A when booting to access the Homebrew Launcher and uninstall CBHC.)
- Don’t uninstall the DS Virtual Console game without [properly uninstalling CBHC first](https://wiiu.hacks.guide/#/uninstall-cbhc)!
- Don’t move the DS Virtual Console game to a USB drive!
