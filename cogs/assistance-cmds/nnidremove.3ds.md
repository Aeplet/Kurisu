**IMPORTANT:** If you are using Pretendo, switch back to Nintendo with Nimbus before following these steps. This will also log you out of your PNID if you have one made!

1. First create a [NAND backup](<https://3ds.hacks.guide/godmode9-usage#creating-a-nand-backup>) (ignore if you recently made one from Finalizing Setup)
2. Then follow [this guide](<https://3ds.hacks.guide/godmode9-usage#removing-an-nnid-without-formatting-your-console>) to log out of the NNID
