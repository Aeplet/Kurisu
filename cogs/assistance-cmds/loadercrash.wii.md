help-desc: Quick steps to check why USB backup loader is crashing
---

If launching your game backups on USB Loader GX or WiiFlow boots to a black screen or returns to the Wii Menu or Homebrew Channel, there are two things you should check:

Did you install cIOS, following this guide? https://wii.hacks.guide/cios
Did you layout your drive exactly as shown in this guide? https://wii.hacks.guide/wii-loaders#game-directory-structure

If you have double-checked both of these things and confirmed that they were done correctly, try re-dumping the game using [CleanRip](https://wii.hacks.guide/dump-games)

If you are still running into issues, please run a [SysCheck](https://wii.hacks.guide/syscheck) and post the results here (this will be syscheck.csv in the root).
